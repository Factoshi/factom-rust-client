/**
Send a Chain Commit Message to factomd to create a new Chain. 
The commit chain hex encoded string is documented here: 
[Github Documentation](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#entry-commit)

The commit-chain API takes a specifically formated message encoded in hex that 
includes signatures. If you have a factom-walletd instance running, you can 
construct this commit-chain API call with compose-chain which takes easier 
to construct arguments.

The compose-chain api call has two api calls in itâ€™s response: 
commit-chain and reveal-chain. To successfully create a chain, the reveal-chain 
must be called after the commit-chain.

Notes:
It is possible to be unable to send a commit, if the commit already exists
 (if you try to send it twice). This is a mechanism to prevent you from double 
 spending. If you encounter this error, just skip to the reveal-chain. The 
 error format can be found here: repeated-commit
